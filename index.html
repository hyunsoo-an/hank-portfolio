                Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I am a full-stack developer
                with a passion for exploring new things and solving problems. I
                am honored to have the opportunity to showcase my skills, and I
                hope to continue learning and growing as a developer. I believe
                that staying comfortable prevents my skills from growing, so
                rather than remaining stagnant, I am determined to overcome my
                limits and actively seek new challenges with a mindset focused
                on continuous learning.
              </p>

            As a final project for Dev Academy, a team of four, including
            myself, developed a service to help users find good coffee shops
            near them over the course of a week. I primarily focused on
            front-end work, including database construction and loading page
            design. This webpage was has been designed with mobile screens in
            mind. However, a limitation is that all coffee shop locations are
            hard-coded in the database, so users can only view a few places in
            Wellington. This is an area for further improvement. I gained
            experience in the overall process of full-stack development and
            developed a deep understanding of API design and database management
            on the back end.
